# 🎯 COMPLETE ANDROID STUDIO SETUP - Step by Step

## ⏳ CURRENT STATUS
✅ Flutter is currently upgrading (running in background)
✅ Project files are ready
✅ Android emulator is available
✅ Blocking processes have been killed

---

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### ⏰ STEP 1: Wait for Flutter Upgrade (2-5 minutes)

The upgrade is running. **DO NOT close the Command Prompt window!**

You'll know it's done when you see something like:
```
Flutter 3.35.7 • channel stable
```

---

### ✅ STEP 2: Verify Flutter Installation

After upgrade completes, run these commands **one by one**:

```cmd
flutter --version
```
Should show Flutter 3.35.7 or higher

```cmd
flutter doctor
```
Should show checkmarks (✓) for Flutter and Android Studio

```cmd
flutter clean
```
Cleans old build files

```cmd
flutter pub get
```
Gets all dependencies

---

### 🎮 STEP 3: Test Run on Windows (FASTEST!)

Before trying Android, test if the app works:

```cmd
flutter run -d windows
```

**This should launch your Flappy Bird Physics app on Windows immediately!**

If it works, your Flutter is fixed! ✅

---

### 📱 STEP 4: Setup for Android

Now let's get Android working:

#### 4a. Fix Android Licenses
```cmd
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```
Type `y` and press Enter for all prompts

#### 4b. Start the Emulator
```cmd
flutter emulators --launch Medium_Phone_API_36.1
```
Wait 30-60 seconds for emulator to fully boot

#### 4c. Check Devices
```cmd
flutter devices
```
You should see your emulator listed as "Medium Phone API 36.1"

#### 4d. Run on Android
```cmd
flutter run
```
The app will build and launch on the emulator!

---

### 🏢 STEP 5: Use Android Studio (GUI Method)

If you prefer using Android Studio instead of command line:

#### 5a. Close All Android Studio Windows
Make sure it's completely closed

#### 5b. Open Project
1. Launch **Android Studio**
2. Click **File** → **Open**
3. Select: `C:\Users\LENOVO\flappy-bird-`

2. Go to **Plugins**
3. Click **Marketplace** tab
4. Search for "Flutter"
5. Click **Install**

#### 5d. Wait for Indexing
Bottom right corner will show "Indexing..." - wait for it to finish (1-3 minutes)

#### 5e. Configure Flutter SDK (if prompted)
1. **File** → **Settings** → **Languages & Frameworks** → **Flutter**
2. Set Flutter SDK path: `C:\flutter\flutter`
3. Click **Apply** → **OK**

#### 5f. Start Emulator
1. Click **Device Manager** icon (phone icon on right toolbar)
2. Find "Medium Phone API 36.1"
3. Click ▶️ **Play** button

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "Flutter SDK not found" in Android Studio
**Solution:**
1. File → Settings → Languages & Frameworks → Flutter
2. Flutter SDK path: `C:\flutter\flutter`
3. Apply → OK

### Problem: "No devices available"
**Solution:**
1. Start emulator from Device Manager
2. Or connect physical phone via USB
3. Run `flutter devices` to verify

### Problem: Build errors about Gradle
**Solution:**
```cmd
cd C:\Users\LENOVO\flappy-bird-
flutter clean
cd android
gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter pub get
```

### Problem: Still getting semantic errors
**Solution:**
```cmd
flutter channel stable
flutter downgrade 3.24.0
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

## 📱 USE PHYSICAL PHONE (Alternative)

Don't want to use emulator? Use your real Android phone:

### Step 1: Enable Developer Mode
1. Open phone **Settings**
2. Go to **About Phone**
3. Tap **Build Number** 7 times
4. You'll see "Developer mode enabled"

### Step 2: Enable USB Debugging
1. Go to **Settings** → **Developer Options**
2. Turn on **USB Debugging**
3. Turn on **Install via USB** (if available)

### Step 3: Connect Phone
1. Connect phone to computer via USB cable
2. On phone, tap **Allow** when "Allow USB debugging?" appears
3. Select **File Transfer** mode (not Charging)

### Step 4: Verify Connection
```cmd
flutter devices
```
You should see your phone model listed

### Step 5: Run
```cmd
flutter run
```
The app installs and launches on your phone!
