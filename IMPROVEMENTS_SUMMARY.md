- **Multiple Categories**:
  - 🐣 Beginner: First Flight, Gravity Rookie
  - 🏅 Score-Based: Quarter Century (25), Half Century (50), Century Club (100)
  - 🌍 Environment-Specific: Achievements for each planet
  - 🎓 Master: Gravity Master, Physics Professor, Perfect Flight

### Achievements List:
1. **🐣 First Flight** - Score 10 in any environment
2. **🌟 Gravity Rookie** - Try all 8 environments
3. **🏅 Quarter Century** - Score 25+
4. **🥈 Half Century** - Score 50+
5. **🥇 Century Club** - Score 100+
6. **🌌 Space Explorer** - Score 30+ in Space
7. **🌙 Lunar Landing** - Score 25+ on Moon
8. **🔴 Mars Colonist** - Score 20+ on Mars
9. **🌍 Earth Master** - Score 30+ on Earth
10. **🟠 Jupiter Survivor** - Score 10+ on Jupiter (hardest!)
11. **🎓 Gravity Master** - Score 20+ on ALL environments
12. **👨‍🏫 Physics Professor** - Score 50+ on 5 different environments
13. **💎 Perfect Flight** - Score 50+ without pausing

### How It Works:
- Automatically tracks your progress
- Shows popup when you unlock achievements
- Saves best scores for each environment
- Counts total games played

## 💫 2. Particle Effects System

### Visual Enhancements:
- **✨ Bird Trail** - Colorful particles follow the bird
- **💥 Collision Explosions** - Particles burst when bird hits pipes
- **🌟 Score Effects** - Celebration particles when scoring
- **🎨 Environment Colors** - Particles match each planet's theme

### Features:
- Smooth 60 FPS particle animations
- Physics-based movement (particles affected by gravity)
- Fade-out effects
- Multiple particle types

---

## 🧪 3. Custom Gravity Mode

### Experimental Features:
- **🎚️ Gravity Slider** - Set any gravity from 0.1 to 50.0 m/s²
- **📊 Reference Points** - Compare to real planets
- **🔬 Perfect for Learning** - Test "what-if" scenarios
- **💡 Interactive Education** - Students experiment with physics

### Use Cases:
- "What if gravity was twice as strong?"
- "What's it like on a tiny asteroid?"
- "How does extreme gravity affect gameplay?"
- Create your own challenge levels!

## 🔊 4. Sound System (Ready for Audio)

### Structure Created:
- **Sound Manager Class** - Handles all audio
- **4 Sound Types**:
  - 🎵 Flap - When bird flaps wings
  - ⭐ Score - When passing through pipes
  - 💥 Hit - When colliding with obstacles
  - 🎊 Achievement - When unlocking achievements

### To Add Actual Sounds (Optional):
1. Add .mp3 files to `assets/sounds/` folder
2. Update `pubspec.yaml` with asset paths
3. Uncomment the play() calls in `sound_manager.dart`

---

## 📱 Updated Features

### Map Selection Screen:
- ✅ New **"Custom Gravity"** button
- ✅ Purple theme for experimental mode
- ✅ Easy access to all features

### Game Improvements Ready for Integration:
- Particle effects rendering
- Achievement tracking during gameplay
- Sound trigger points
- Custom gravity support

---

## 📊 Technical Details

### New Files Created:
1. `lib/models/achievement.dart` - Achievement data model
2. `lib/utils/achievement_manager.dart` - Achievement logic & persistence
3. `lib/utils/particle_system.dart` - Particle physics & rendering
4. `lib/utils/sound_manager.dart` - Audio management
5. `lib/screens/custom_gravity_screen.dart` - Custom gravity UI

### Updated Files:
1. `pubspec.yaml` - Added dependencies (audioplayers, shared_preferences)
2. `lib/screens/map_selection_screen.dart` - Added custom gravity button

### Dependencies Added:
- `audioplayers: ^5.2.1` - For sound effects
- `shared_preferences: ^2.2.2` - For saving progress

---

## 🎯 Next Steps to Complete Integration

### Step 1: Get Dependencies
```cmd
flutter pub get
```

### Step 2: Update Game Screen
I need to integrate the particle effects and achievement checking into your game_screen.dart. This involves:
- Adding particle system to game loop
- Showing achievement popups
- Triggering sound effects
- Tracking pause state for achievements

### Step 3: Test Everything
- Run on your phone
- Try unlocking achievements
- Test custom gravity mode
- Verify particles show correctly

## 🎓 Perfect for Your Physics Presentation!

### Why These Improvements Help:

1. **🏆 Achievements** - Motivate students to try all gravity levels
2. **💫 Particles** - Make it look professional and polished
3. **🧪 Custom Gravity** - Direct hands-on physics experimentation
4. **🔊 Sounds** - Make it feel like a real game (when audio added)

### Demo Flow for Class:
1. Show the 8 preset environments
2. Demonstrate **Custom Gravity Mode**
3. Set gravity to 1.0 m/s² and show slow-motion effect
4. Set gravity to 30.0 m/s² and show extreme difficulty
5. Explain how achievements teach physics concepts
6. Show particle effects highlighting physics in action
