## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Four Gravity Environments
- **🌍 Earth** (9.8 m/s²) - Standard difficulty
- **🌙 Moon** (1.6 m/s²) - Easy mode, slow falling
- **🪐 Jupiter** (24.8 m/s²) - Hard mode, fast falling
- **🚀 Space** (0.5 m/s²) - Microgravity, floating

### 2. Real Physics Implementation
- ✅ Accurate gravitational values from astronomy
- ✅ Kinematic equations (v = v₀ + at)
- ✅ 60 FPS physics simulation
- ✅ Real-time velocity & acceleration display

### 3. Educational Features
- Live physics data during gameplay
- Visual comparison of different gravities
- Interactive learning experience
- Code is well-documented for study

### 4. Mobile-Ready
- Portrait-mode optimized
- Touch controls
- Responsive design
- Works on Android & iOS

## 🎮 How It Works

### Physics Engine

```dart
// Every frame (60 times per second):
1. Update bird velocity based on gravity
   velocity = velocity + (gravity × time)

2. Update bird position based on velocity
   position = position + (velocity × time)

3. When player taps: give upward velocity
   velocity = -12 (flap strength)

4. Check if bird hit pipes or boundaries
   → Game over if collision detected
```

### Game Flow

```
Start App
    ↓
Map Selection Screen
    ↓
Select Gravity Environment (Earth/Moon/Jupiter/Space)
    ↓
Game Ready Screen
    ↓
Tap to Start
    ↓
[Game Loop - 60 FPS]
├── Apply gravity to bird
├── Move pipes left
├── Check collisions
├── Update score
└── Display physics data
    ↓
Hit pipe or boundary → Game Over
    ↓
Show Final Score & Stats
    ↓
Play Again or Change Map
```

## 📊 Physics Comparison

| Environment | Gravity | Difficulty | Fall Speed | Best For |
|-------------|---------|------------|------------|----------|
| 🚀 Space    | 0.5 m/s² | Very Easy | Very Slow | Learning controls |
| 🌙 Moon     | 1.6 m/s² | Easy | Slow | Beginners |
| 🌍 Earth    | 9.8 m/s² | Normal | Medium | Standard gameplay |
| 🪐 Jupiter  | 24.8 m/s² | Hard | Fast | Challenge mode |

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Install Flutter (if not done)
```bash
# Check if Flutter is installed
flutter --version

# If not, follow SETUP_GUIDE.md
```

### 2. Get Dependencies
```bash
cd flappy-bird-
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Run on Emulator
```bash
# Start emulator, then:
flutter run
```

### 4. Or Build APK for Phone
```bash
# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release

# Find APK at:
# build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# Transfer to phone and install
```

## 📖 Documentation Guide

Read the docs in this order:

1. **README.md** - Overview, features, installation
2. **SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Detailed installation steps
3. **PHYSICS_GUIDE.md** - How physics is implemented
4. **PRESENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Tips for class presentation

## 🎯 For Your Physics Class

### What to Demonstrate

1. **Different Gravities**
   - Show all 4 environments
   - Compare fall speeds
   - Explain the physics differences

2. **Real-Time Physics**
   - Point out velocity display
   - Show acceleration values
   - Explain how they change

3. **Code Implementation**
   - Open `bird.dart` to show equations
   - Show `map_data.dart` for gravity values
   - Explain the game loop

### Learning Objectives

Students will understand:
- ✅ What gravitational acceleration means
- ✅ How velocity changes over time (v = v₀ + at)
- ✅ Why objects fall faster on bigger planets
- ✅ What microgravity feels like
- ✅ How physics applies to real-world scenarios

## 💡 Customization Ideas

### Easy Modifications

**1. Change Gravity Values**
Edit `lib/models/map_data.dart`:
```dart
'mars': MapData(
  name: 'Mars',
  icon: '🔴',
  gravity: 3.7,  // Mars gravity
  description: 'Red planet!',
  // ...
)
```

**2. Adjust Difficulty**
Edit `lib/models/bird.dart`:
```dart
final double flapStrength = -15;  // Stronger flaps
```

**3. Change Pipe Speed**
Edit `lib/screens/game_screen.dart`:
```dart
double pipeSpeed = 3;  // Slower pipes (easier)
```

**4. Modify Pipe Gap**
Edit `lib/models/pipe.dart`:
```dart
this.gapHeight = 250,  // Bigger gap (easier)
```
