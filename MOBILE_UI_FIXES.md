# Mobile UI Fixes - Layout and Scrolling Issues 📱

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Bottom Overflow in Map Selection (Phone)
**Problem:** When running on phone, bottom overflow errors appeared in map selection screen.

**Solution:**
- Changed GridView from fixed height `SizedBox` to `shrinkWrap: true`
- Added `physics: NeverScrollableScrollPhysics()` to GridView
- Let the outer `SingleChildScrollView` handle all scrolling
- Added extra bottom padding (30px) to prevent cutoff

**Before:**
```dart
SizedBox(
  height: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.55,
  child: GridView.count(...),
)
```

**After:**
```dart
GridView.count(
  shrinkWrap: true,
  physics: const NeverScrollableScrollPhysics(),
  ...
)
```

### 2. Splash Screen Title Not Centered
**Problem:** "FLAPPY BIRD" title on loading screen wasn't properly centered.

**Solution:**
- Wrapped the title Container in a `Center` widget
- Added `alignment: Alignment.center` to the Stack
- Ensures perfect centering on all screen sizes

**Before:**
```dart
Container(
  padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(...),
  child: Stack(
    children: [Text('FLAPPY BIRD'), ...]
  ),
)
```

**After:**
```dart
Center(
  child: Container(
    padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(...),
    child: Stack(
      alignment: Alignment.center,
      children: [Text('FLAPPY BIRD'), ...]
    ),
  ),
)
```

### 3. Map Selection Title Alignment
**Problem:** "FLAPPY BIRD" title in map selection was misaligned because of the bird logo next to it.

**Solution:**
- Removed the Row layout with bird icon
- Centered the title independently
- Much cleaner, more professional look
- Title now perfectly centered on all devices

**Before:**
```dart
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
  children: [
    // Bird icon
    Container(...bird...),
    SizedBox(width: 15),
    // Title
    Container('FLAPPY BIRD'),
  ],
)
```

**After:**
```dart
Center(
  child: Container(
    child: Text('FLAPPY BIRD'),
  ),
)
```

### 4. "Pick a Planet!" Label Removed
**Problem:** The "Pick a Planet!" label was redundant - users already understand they need to tap a planet.

**Solution:**
- Completely removed the "Pick a Planet!" container
- Cleaner, less cluttered UI
- More screen space for the planet grid
- "Choose Your World" subtitle is sufficient

**Removed:**
```dart
Container(
  child: Row(
    children: [
      Text('🪐'),
      Text('Pick a Planet!'),
      Text('🪐'),
    ],
  ),
)
```

---

### 5. Scroll Behavior Fixed
**Problem:** When scrolling down in map selection, hitting the bottom wouldn't allow scrolling the full screen.

**Root Cause:** GridView had its own scrolling physics conflicting with outer scroll.

**Solution:**
- GridView now uses `shrinkWrap: true` (takes only needed height)
- GridView uses `NeverScrollableScrollPhysics()` (doesn't scroll itself)
- Outer `SingleChildScrollView` handles all scrolling
- Added bottom padding to ensure smooth scroll to end

**Technical Changes:**
```dart
// Outer scroll
SingleChildScrollView(
  child: Column(
    children: [
      // Grid doesn't scroll, just sizes itself
      GridView.count(
        shrinkWrap: true,
        physics: const NeverScrollableScrollPhysics(),
        children: [...],
      ),
      // Extra padding at bottom
      SizedBox(height: 30),
    ],
  ),
)
```
