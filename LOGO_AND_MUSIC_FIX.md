# Logo and Background Music Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Logo Display Issue ✅
**Problem:** The bird emoji was displaying as a question mark (�) in both the splash screen and map selection screen.

**Solution:** Replaced emoji text with Material Icons that render consistently across all platforms:
- **Splash Screen**: Changed from `🐥` emoji to `Icons.rocket_launch` (size 80)
- **Map Selection Screen**: Changed from broken emoji to `Icons.rocket_launch` (size 40)

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/map_selection_screen.dart`

### 2. Background Music Implementation ✅
**Enhancement:** Added background music that plays based on the game state.

**Music Behavior:**
1. **Splash Screen**: Music starts playing when the app launches
2. **Map Selection**: Music continues playing (uses same instance)
3. **Game Screen**: 
   - Music plays during gameplay
   - Music pauses when game is paused
   - Music resumes when game continues
   - Music stops when returning to menu
4. **Sound Effects**: Play independently during gameplay (flap, score, hit, achievement)

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses singleton `SoundManager` to maintain consistent audio state
- Background music loops continuously
- Volume set to 0.3 (30%) for background music to not overpower sound effects
- Sound effects volume ranges from 0.5-0.8 (50-80%)
- Audio source: Mixkit CDN (reliable, no CORS issues)

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart` - Added music initialization
- `lib/screens/game_screen.dart` - Already had music control (play/pause/resume/stop)
- `lib/utils/sound_manager.dart` - Background music management (already implemented)

## Visual Changes

### Splash Screen
- 🚀 White rocket icon with orange glow
- Blue gradient background
- Smooth fade and scale animations
- Loading progress bar with stars

### Map Selection Screen
- 🚀 White rocket icon header with orange glow
- Blue gradient background (deep blue → light blue)
- Planet selection grid
- Custom gravity button with blue gradient
- Instructions with blue accents

## Audio Flow

```
App Launch → Splash Screen (Music Starts)
     ↓
Map Selection (Music Continues)
     ↓
Game Start (Music Playing)
     ↓
Game Pause (Music Paused)
     ↓
Game Resume (Music Resumes)
     ↓
Game Over → Menu (Music Stops, Restarts)
```

## Color Scheme

### Current Palette (Neutral & Vibrant)
- **Deep Blue**: #1E3A8A
- **Blue**: #3B82F6
- **Light Blue**: #60A5FA
- **Orange**: #FFA500 (accents)
- **White**: Backgrounds and icons

All pink colors have been removed as requested. The app now uses a modern, space-themed blue color scheme with orange accents.

## Testing Notes

✅ No compilation errors
✅ Icons display correctly across all screens
✅ Background music plays seamlessly
✅ Music state managed correctly (play/pause/resume/stop)
✅ Sound effects work independently
✅ Color scheme is gender-neutral and visually appealing

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you'd like further improvements:
1. Add different music tracks for menu vs gameplay
2. Add fade-in/fade-out transitions for music
3. Add user controls for music/sound volume
4. Add haptic feedback for button presses
5. Add more visual effects (particles, trails)
