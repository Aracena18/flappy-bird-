## 🚀 The App is Building Now!

I've already started running `flutter run` - the app is building and will install on your phone automatically.

### What's Happening:

1. ⚙️ **Gradle is building the Android APK** (2-3 minutes for first build)
2. 📦 **Installing the app on your phone**
3. 🚀 **Launching the app automatically**

### You'll See:

On your phone screen:
1. ✨ **Splash Screen** with "Flappy Bird Physics" title
2. 🎯 **Map Selection Screen** with 8 gravity environments
3. 🎮 **Game Screen** when you select an environment

---

## ⏳ First Build Takes Longer

**First time:** 2-5 minutes (downloading Gradle, building everything)  
**Next times:** 20-30 seconds (incremental builds)

---

## 📱 On Your Phone - Make Sure:

### ✅ USB Debugging is Enabled
If you see a popup on your phone asking to "Allow USB debugging?":
- ✅ **Tap "Allow"**
- ✅ Check "Always allow from this computer" (optional)

### ✅ Installation Permission
If you see "Do you want to install this app?":
- ✅ **Tap "Install"**

---

## 🎮 How to Use the App

### 1. Splash Screen (3 seconds)
- Animated loading screen
- Automatically proceeds to map selection

### 2. Map Selection Screen
Choose from 8 gravity environments:

| Environment | Gravity | Difficulty |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| 🌌 Space | 0.5 m/s² | ⭐ Easiest |
| 🌙 Moon | 1.6 m/s² | ⭐⭐ Very Easy |
| 🔴 Mars | 3.7 m/s² | ⭐⭐ Easy |
| 🟡 Venus | 8.9 m/s² | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium |
| 🌍 Earth | 9.8 m/s² | ⭐⭐⭐ Medium |
| 🪐 Saturn | 10.4 m/s² | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hard |
| 🔵 Neptune | 11.2 m/s² | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hard |
| 🟠 Jupiter | 24.8 m/s² | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Hard |

**Tap any card** to select that environment.

### 3. Game Screen
- **Tap anywhere** on screen to make the bird flap
- **Avoid the pipes** (green obstacles)
- **Watch the physics values** at the top:
  - Velocity (m/s)
  - Acceleration (m/s²)
- **Score** increases as you pass pipes
- **Pause button** (⏸️) in top-right corner

### 4. Game Over
- Shows your final score
- **Tap "RESTART"** to play again in same environment
- **Tap "MENU"** to return to map selection

## 🎓 For Your Physics Class Presentation

### Demo Tips:

1. **Start with Space (easiest)**
   - Show how low gravity = slow falling
   - Easy to demonstrate physics without dying instantly

2. **Compare with Earth**
   - Familiar gravity (9.8 m/s²)
   - Show how it's "normal" difficulty

3. **Show Jupiter (hardest)**
   - Extreme gravity (24.8 m/s²)
   - Bird falls VERY fast
   - Dramatic difference for impact!

4. **Point out the physics values**
   - Velocity changes in real-time
   - Gravity constant stays the same
   - Shows actual physics calculations

## 🔥 Hot Reload (During Development)

While the app is running, if you make code changes:

1. Save your files in VS Code
2. In the terminal where `flutter run` is active, press:
   - **`r`** = Hot reload (fast, keeps state)
   - **`R`** = Hot restart (full restart)
   - **`q`** = Quit app

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: App doesn't install
**Solution:**
1. Check phone screen for permission popups
2. Make sure USB debugging is allowed
3. Try: `flutter run -v` (verbose mode to see details)

### Problem: "Offline device"
**Solution:**
1. Unplug and replug USB cable
2. On phone: Disable and re-enable USB debugging
3. Run: `flutter devices` to check connection

### Problem: Build fails
**Solution:**
```cmd
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Problem: Gradle build error
**Solution:**
```cmd
cd android
gradlew clean
cd ..
flutter run
```

## 📦 Building APK for Sharing

Want to install the app without computer?

### Debug APK (for testing):
```cmd
flutter build apk --debug
```
Location: `build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-debug.apk`

### Release APK (smaller, faster):
```cmd
flutter build apk --release
```
Location: `build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk`

### Install APK:
1. Copy the `.apk` file to your phone
2. Open file manager on phone
3. Tap the `.apk` file
4. Allow "Install from Unknown Sources" if prompted
5. Tap "Install"

Now you can demo without the computer! 🎉
